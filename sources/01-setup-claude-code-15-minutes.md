Made for non-technical people. Learn, step by step, how to use Claude Code without scary dev terms.

## I. What is Claude Code?

Anthropic's coding platform that lets engineers and novices "vibe code" with the help of AI.

**The Simple Version:**
Claude Code lets AI read, write, and edit files stored on your computer or a server.

Think of it like this: You're probably used to talking with AI in a chat window and manually adjusting your documents. Claude Code allows AI to directly review and modify those files (spreadsheets, docs, notes, etc.), without you needing to copy/paste or attach reference documents.

**Some Helpful Background:**
- Claude Code has been around since February 2025
- It was created by developers, for developers
- It's largely been the go-to tool for coding since its release

## II. Why Is Claude Code Having a Moment?

Three things happened in late 2025/early 2026:

### 1. Claude's newest model was a big capability jump
Opus 4.5 was released late November 2025. Using Opus 4.5 with Claude Code gives crazy results. Many agree this is the first model that feels like a senior engineering teammate. It is much better at complex coding and workflow tasks.

### 2. Claude Code updates have made it better at doing work
Anthropic released version 2.0 of Claude Code in late September 2025. New versions added:
- **Bigger Context Windows**: Process and remember significantly more info at once
- **Skills**: Save specific sets of instructions or complex workflows
- **Subagents**: Claude can split itself into smaller versions that work on different tasks simultaneously
- **Hooks**: Set up rules so specific actions happen automatically
- **Better Orchestration**: Claude can create multi-step plans, carry out steps one by one, and verify results

### 3. Real-world builds are finally good enough to go viral

## III. Why Non-Technical People Should Care

It's called Claude Code... but that doesn't mean you need to use it to code.

### Automate repetitive work at scale
- Clean messy spreadsheets (fix columns, standardize data)
- Batch rename hundreds of files with consistent naming
- Convert customer feedback into categorized insights
- Generate weekly reports from raw data

### Build simple tools and prototypes
- Ad copy scorer that ranks variations and suggests tweaks
- SEO audit tool that scans your site for broken links and keyword gaps
- To-do app customized to your quarterly tasks
- Campaign performance analyzer that flags weak spots

### Find insights you're missing
- Feed it 6 months of customer calls to see what's killing your close rate
- Build a second brain from your notes or email archives
- Drop in competitor content to map positioning gaps you can own
- Share campaign data to spot which audience segments you're ignoring

## IV. Where To Start

You'll need a paid Claude subscription (starts at $20/month in the US).

### 1. Claude Desktop App (Start Here)
- Download it, click "Code" in left-hand nav
- Easiest setup, most user-friendly interface

### 2. Claude Web Browser
- Log into Claude.ai, click "Code" in left-hand nav
- Requires GitHub account
- No installs, works anywhere

### 3. Code Editor Tools (IDEs: Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code)
- Download an IDE, open Terminal, run commands to install Claude Code
- See file changes Claude Code makes
- More edit and review control

### 4. Terminal (CLI)
- Open Terminal app, run commands to download Claude Code
- Fast setup, AI works faster
- Handles giant folders that other versions can't

### 5. Claude Chrome Extension
- Install the extension, requires CLI version 2.0.73+
- Gives Claude Code access to the web and real-time data
- Sees open tabs, automates browser tasks

## V. How to Get Started in <15 Minutes

1. Open Claude Desktop app
2. Click "Code" in the left-hand navigation menu
3. Install dependencies (if prompted)
4. Click "+ New Session" for each new project or workflow
5. Click "..." in the chatbox to choose model (Opus 4.5 for complex, Sonnet 4.5 for simpler)
6. Click "Select folder" and give Claude Code access to specific files
7. Describe your request in detail within the chat box
8. Claude will notify you when the task is complete
9. Check its work and guide next steps

**Pro Tips:**
- Opus 4.5 consumes usage limits much faster than Sonnet 4.5
- Back up any files you include
- Use "Plan" mode for complex tasks needing structure

## VI. Getting The Most Out of Claude Code

### Take Advantage of the Big Context Window
Drop reports into a folder and ask for themes. Feed it your documentation library. Create context files of formatted info AI can access on demand (ICPs, business results, competitor info).

### Pair Claude Code with Skills
Skills save your instructions so you don't re-explain yourself. Build a Skill for any process you run repeatedly.

### Turn Repeat Tasks Into Scripts
After Claude Code completes a task, ask it to turn the process into a script. Next time, tell Claude Code to "Run the [script name]."

### Use Sub-Agents for Multi-Part Projects
For complex tasks, Claude Code can split work across smaller "sub-agents" that work simultaneously. Use when you have 2+ tasks that don't depend on each other.

### Set Up Hooks for Automatic Actions
Hooks trigger specific actions at key points in your workflow. Examples: auto-backup files before changes, run error checks after edits, send notifications when tasks complete.

## VII. When to Graduate Beyond the Desktop App

- **Web Browser**: Multiple devices, GitHub, team collaboration
- **Code Editors**: See file changes, edit code/complex docs, more review control
- **Terminal (CLI)**: Huge data sets, faster performance, scheduled automation
- **Chrome Extension**: Web page interaction, data scraping, real-time web access
